🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is a significant factor impacting business revenue and customer satisfaction. This project provides a predictive model to help businesses identify customers at risk, enabling proactive retention strategies.

⭐ Features
Data-Driven Insights: The model evaluates factors contributing to churn, such as contract type, tenure, and support services.
Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard to visualize churn drivers and trends.
API Deployment: A Flask API enables real-time churn predictions, easily integrated into web and mobile applications.
📊 Data
Dataset
We used the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes:

Customer Demographics: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents.
Service Usage: phone service, multiple lines, internet service, online security, tech support.
Account Information: contract type, payment method, monthly charges, tenure.
Target Variable
Churn: A binary variable indicating if a customer has churned ("Yes") or not ("No").
⚙️ Installation

Sample Input:
json
Copy code
{
    "num__tenure": 12,
    "num__MonthlyCharges": 50.30,
    "cat__PaymentMethod": "Electronic check",
    "cat__Contract_TwoYear": 0,
    "cat__OnlineSecurity_Yes": 0,
    "cat__TechSupport_Yes": 1,
    "cat__MultipleLines_Yes": 1,
    "cat__InternetService_Fiber": 1
}
📱 Mobile Accessibility
The API is optimized for mobile compatibility, providing real-time access to churn insights on mobile devices.

🔧 Model Training
The model was trained using a subset of customer features, focusing on accuracy and interpretability.

Model Details
Preprocessing: Encoded categorical variables; scaled numerical features.
Algorithm: Model selection based on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
📈 Dashboard and API
Power BI Dashboard: Easily interpretable visuals of key churn factors.
Flask API: Real-time predictions through a RESTful API, accessible on web and mobile.
